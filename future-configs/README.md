# 🚧 Future Configs — Coming Soon 🚧

Welcome to the **Future Configs** section of [Ribhav-NixOS-configs](https://github.com/N00B-5634/Ribhav-NixOS-configs)!

## ⚠️ Why Is This Directory Empty?

This folder is **intentionally left empty** — for now.  
It’s a placeholder for **upcoming configurations, beta projects, and experimental setups** that will be added as I learn more about software development and system design.

Think of this as a **"unstable branch"** for future ideas that will later become part of my master branch.

## 🧩 What to Expect Here

Once development starts, you can expect to find:
- 🔧 Early prototypes and **beta configs** for apps I’m creating  
- 🧠 Experimental **NixOS modules and scripts**  
- 🧰 Personal projects related to automation, dev environments, and testing  

These files might be unstable or incomplete — they’ll serve as **learning experiments** and **early previews**.

## 🕓 When Will Updates Arrive?

Updates will appear here **as I learn and build more**.  
If you’d like to stay notified, consider:
- ⭐ **Starring** the repo  
- 🕵️ **Watching** for changes  
- 💬 **Opening an issue** if you’d like to suggest ideas or contribute
