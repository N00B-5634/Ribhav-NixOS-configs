# Warning — Laptop Configuration 

Welcome to the **Laptop Configuration** section of [My NixOS Repo](https://github.com/N00B-5634/Ribhav-NixOS-configs)!

---

## Important Notice

This directory contains **my personal laptop setup** — it is **not identical** to the configuration used on my desktop system.

Each device has its own environment, hardware, and workflow preferences, so expect differences in:
- Installed packages and services  
- System options and hardware drivers  
- UI tweaks and performance optimizations  

If you’re comparing configs or trying to replicate my setup, please double-check which device you’re looking at.

## About This Config

This configuration is:
- Tailored for **laptop performance and mobility**  
- Optimized for **battery life, power management, and portability**  
- Slightly different from the **desktop setup**, which focuses more on raw power and workstation efficiency
